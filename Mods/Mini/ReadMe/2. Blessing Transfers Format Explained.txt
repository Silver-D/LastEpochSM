This file is a detailed explanation of the blessingTransfers configuration section.

Please use a Monospaced font for this document, as it has examples of json that
may be difficult to understand without monospaced formatting.

When thoroughly configured, this section allows Transfers of Blessings from one
Monolith Timeline into another. This makes it possible to have, for example,
Critical Strike Multiplier and Chritical Hit Chance blessings on different
Timelines -- allowing you to finally have the option of equipping both of these
blessings at the same time.
    It also allows you to remove useless blessings from Timelines, making
it much easier to farm for specific blessings -- and the freedom to fully
configure an entire set of Timeline Blessings in order to have any desired
combination of blessings equipped at all times.
    This works for the Blessing Rewards that you get when beating the Timeline Boss,
and even works properly for blessings that you have already unlocked and discovered.
And if you have the blessings in questions equipped, you just need to unequip them
for them to jump to their configured Timelines.
+ You need to have more than one blessing discovered in a timeline in order to equip
a different blessing -- just something to keep in mind when moving blessings around.

The format is a little bit complicated, but I hope it is powerful.
It is also a pain in the butt to configure, but here we go.

The BlessingTransfers.json file comes with some default values, here are the default values
for Fall of the Outcasts:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "firstSlotBlessings": {},
    "otherSlotBlessings": {},
    "anySlotBlessings": {}
    },

First, you need to set the 'enableBlessingTransfers' to true in the Mini\Conf.json for this
file to be processed.
But even with 'enableBlessingTransfers' option enabled, this will not do anything by itself.
Let's take a look.
Every timeline has firstSlotBlessings, otherSlotBlessings, and anySlotBlessings arrays.
For a list of blessings and what slots they are in, refer to
https://www.lastepochtools.com/endgame/monolith/the-black-sun/normal/blessings
or
https://lastepoch.tunklab.com/timelines

If you go to Fall of the Outcasts page on those site, it will have 'Slots 2&3', and 'Any Slot'
blessings listed for that timeline. These are 'otherSlotBlessings', and 'anySlotBlessings',
respectively.

Now let's say you want to change the blessings and the rewards that are in those slots for
Fall of the Outcasts. The first thing that goes into the _SlotBlessings arrays is an action.

Supported actions are: 'clear', 'remove', 'transfer', and 'swap'.

Let's go one by one. Example:

* clear: This action only has one parameter: true/false. If true, it will remove all blessings
from that section in that Timeline. Example:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "otherSlotBlessings": { "clear": true }
},
...

The above example will remove all blessings from 'Slots 2&3' section in Fall of the Outcasts.
It is important to note that _EVERYTHING_ in the .conf file is CASE-SENSITIVE.
All Timeline names all need to be lowercase, and exactly as in the provided config file.

* remove: This action removes specific blessings from that specific section. Example:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "anySlotBlessings": { "remove": [1,2] }
},
...

This will remove 'Strength of Mind', and 'Scales of Greed' from 'Any Slot' in
Fall of the Outcasts Timeline.

It is important to note, that these are _indexes_ of those blessings that are in those
blessingSlots, and indexes start at 0.
If you look at the Blessing List on those sites, the Blessing that is at index 0
of "Any Slot" (anySlotBlessings) in Fall of the Outcasts timeline is 'Winds of Fortune',
index 1 would be 'Strength of Mind', and 2 is 'Scales of Greed'.
Putting 3 here will throw an 'index out of range' error and abort the parser.
(I think I put some error checking with some more meaningful error messages, but either way,
the parser will abort the Transfer Section in its entireity if it sees something it doesn't like.
Check the output log in the MelonLoader's Console or its Latest Log file to see how far the parser
got before you broke it!:)).

This, and any other actions on blessings in this module apply to both the Normal and Grand versions
of those blessings. You don't (and can't) configure them separately.

It is also important to note now, that it is enitirely okay to completely leave blessings
unassigned and hanging, as well as have an entire timeline that consists of only one blessing.
In this case, the UI for the Blessing Reward Panel will get a bit confused, however, and will
offer that one blessing multiple times with different rolls on each. This is not an issue.

Okay, with me still? Okay. Next one is up is 'transfer':

* transfer: Transfers specified blessings from other timelines into this one.
We know how to remove blessings, now let's insert a blessing into Fall of the Outcasts.

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "firstSlotBlessings": {
        "transfer": {
            "the black sun": { "otherSlotBlessings": [5] }
        }
    }
}
...

Right. Okay. Let's break this down.

The parser sees: what timeline are we performing on? fall of the outcasts'. Specifically, its firstSlotBlessings section.
Action to perform here? 'transfer'. It now wants to know where we are transferring from. That would be
'the black sun'. And we need to specify which sections we want our blessings to come from, and that
is the 'Slots 2&3' (otherSlotBlessings) section. And what specific blessings do we want from that list?
For now we want one, the blessing from The Black Sun's 'Slots2&3' section at index 5. Which is 'Winds of Oblivion',
the Critical Chance blessing.

Congratulations, you can now equip Winds of Oblivion by selecting the Fall of the Outcasts timeline at the Blessing Respec guy
(unequip it to refresh the list if you have it already equipped somewhere else. Or disable/change config, equip something else
in that timeline, then enable config. Remember you can't switch blessings if you only have one blessing availble in a timeline).
And we also always get it as a choice in the Blessing Rewards Panel after beating the Fall of the Outcasts' boss.
This is because we put Winds of Oblivion in the 'firstSlotBlessings' section (which is empty by default for Fall of the Outcasts),
and the 'firstSlotBlessings', if not empty, always populates the first choice of the Blessings Reward Panel.

One last thing, the index indicating the blessing that we want to transfer-- it has to be an array. It cannot be just 5, it has to be [5].
Or we can specify multiple with [5,6]. Etc. (oh oh oh, foreshadowing alert, foreshadowing alert!)

Got it? Probably not. But you can also chain actions, as follows:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "otherSlotBlessings": { "clear": true,
                            "transfer": {
                                "the black sun": {
                                    "otherSlotBlessings": [5]
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    ...

First, we completely clear the 'Slots 2&3' section from Fall of the Outcasts, and then we transfer 'Winds of Oblivion'
from The Black Sun's otherSlotBlessings section into it, making it the only available blessing for 'Slots2&3' section for Fall of the Outcasts.
This is a buff.
And now, some more wall of text of further explanation:
(And before that, yes, the actions are executed in the specified order. Putting a blessing into a section, and then clearing it.. clears the section.)

What we've done in the above examples is move Winds of Oblivion from The Black Sun into Fall of The Outcasts.
Winds of Oblivion is no longer available in The Black Sun's timeline sections, that means you cannot reference it in the config directly anymore.
However, you do not really need to keep track of indexes shifting (they don't). For example, if after transfering Winds of Oblivion, you want to
reference 'Greed of Darkness', which is at index 7 of The Black Sun's 'Slots 2&3', it still is at index 7, and you can still do whatever you want
with it later down in your config. You do not need to keep track of those indexes in that sense, however, if you try to directly reference its
old location, index 5, which we've moved, the parser will panic and abort. It knows you've moved, cleared, or removed it.
It will know. It knows.

As a side note, when you 'remove', or 'clear' blessings, they are lost forever. You can no longer find or reference them in your parser config.
(Or in the game, for that matter -- that is, until you change your transfers config. The changes are applied every time you start your game,
but are never really saved. The parser just runs every time you first load any character into the game.
Again, any changes you make to the transfers config requires you to restart your game for the parser to re-parse the Timelines data.
I do not keep a backup copy of the data after the parser has done its dirty deed.).

As a back note, by "transferring" blessings to a section, you're "adding" it to that section -- if I didn't make that very understandable.
So, while indexes never decrease and the lists never physically shrink, they definitely do expand, and the transferred blessings are assigned
new sequential indexes. But that shouldn't matter too often. Is there even a use case for when you transfer a blessing and then want to
reference it at its new location to move it again? Well, you can.

I would also like to emphasize something further, that the Timeline changes you make are not anything character-specific.
They are changes to the game data for the entirety of your current game session, so take advantage of that -- configure your blessings as such,
so that every character and class you play can benefit from your config. Or keep different configs handy. Huh, maybe I should move them to some presets.
Character presets?
Nono, shutup, shutup, stop giving me ideas. Let me finish the documents first at least, argh!

ANYWAY -- You must have further questions and some confusions. No? Well, please indulge me anyway, I'm lonely and I have nothing
better to do than to bloat this document with meaningless ramblings.

Okay. Back to examples. As you may have keenly noticed, everything is a "key" in theese data arrays. Which means, we cannot have two of the same action
back to back in the same section.

As such,
"otherSlotBlessings": { "transfer": { "timeline name": .. },
           INVALID ---> "transfer": { "other timeline": .. } <--- INVALID

So what do we do? Well.. This is the tricky part with this config.
Let's see if you can't figure this example out. This will be on the test, btw.

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "otherSlotBlessings": { "clear": true,
                            "transfer": {
                                "the black sun": {
                                    "otherSlotBlessings": [5]
                                },
                                "ending the storm": {
                                    "firstSlotBlessings": [1],
                                    "otherSlotBlessings": [0,6]
                            }
                        }
                    },
    "anySlotBlessings": { "remove": [2] }
}

Is it clear now? I hope so. We emptied the 'Slots 2&3' section in the timeline, then moved one blessing from The Black Sun's 'Slots 2&3' section,
and 3 blessings from Ending the Storm's sections -- all into Fall of the Outcasts' 'Slots 2&3' section.
Oh, and we also removed a blessing from Fall of the Outcasts' 'Any Slot' section while we were at it.

I do not know exactly what this does in terms of gameplay, but it is valid. Note (take a shot when you read note), that these are just
examples of valid things my demented parser actually digests. Do not use these in game. Real-world examples will be in a separate json
filled with actual useful things. Someday. I hope. I need more coffee. Maybe you can even make a decent one for others to use, who knows?
I mean. You're still reading. And we still haven't covered the last action yet! No no, trust me, everything else was important to explain.
Maybe my timing was off. I'm not a comedian. Was never fun at parties, either.

Okay, actions! We have Swap! You're going to hate this. Oh so much. Well, maybe not, or yes, but I definitely hated writing the parser to support it.

* swap: Swap!
The problem with the above format is .. YES Yes I know it's a pain in the butt, okay let me start over.
The _other_ problem with the format is.. Uhh I actually can't think of another one. I totally did when I knew we needed 'swap' Blimey. I'll update this
section when I remember exactly why I had to implement the swap action. But I did. So here you go. Anyway, swap Example!:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "anySlotBlessings": { "swap": {
                                "2": {
                                    "the black sun": {
                                        "otherSlotBlessings": 5
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }

Ohh boy. Okay, first of all, notice the "2". That is not an integer, it is a "key". It is both the indicator which exact blessing index we want to swap,
and it also holds the Timeline's data that indicates with which exact blessing index we're swapping places with.
Even an online JSON Validator (which I strongly suggest you use) will scream at you if you try to put a 2: there instead of a "2":. It's out of my hands.
And that "2": represents the index in Fall of the Outcasts' 'Any Slot' blessing, which is, as we already know, is 'Scales of Greed'.
All in all, at the end of the operation, we end up with:
'Winds of Oblivion' from The Black Sun's 'Slots 2&3' (the 5) is moved to Fall of The Outcast's 'Any Slot' section, to the index where
'Scales of Greed' (the 2) is-- and 'Scales of Greed' is moved to The Black Sun's 'Slots 2&3' section, to the index where Winds of Oblivion was.
Not sure if I'm explaining this clearly enough, but it should make some sense I hope.
It's still not going to let you swap a blessing that has been moved or removed, on either side of the swap.
Use the 'transfer' action to add a blessing that you want to that list instead.

Another thing to note (ding) is that everything proceeding the "2": index can only hold exactly one entry. Obviously, because
we're swapping exactly one specific blessing with exactly one other specific blessing.
That means, that, "index": can only be followed by one timeline, and that timeline can only be followed by one section, and that secion can only.. well....
no, no, you can actually write [5] in there if you want. Actually you can actually put [5,2,420,69] there if you really want to, but it will still
only read it as 5 (the first index of the array, if it's an array). You're welcome. (The main reason I wrote it like that is when I looked at my config,
it was the only trailing index number that was a number that didnt like having []s around it, and it was annoying to notice why I was getting invalid type
exceptions at first).

Hooowever, you can still do this:

"fall of the outcasts": {
    "anySlotBlessings": { "swap": {
                                "2": {
                                    "the black sun": {
                                        "otherSlotBlessings": 5
                                    }
                                },
                                "1": {
                                    "the age of winter": {
                                        "otherSlotBlessings": 6
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }

Anyway. That about covers it. Yes/No? $_

As a side side note (DING), one interesting observation as I am finishing writing this document and scrolling up, I am noticing a peculiar consistent
increase in the length of these lines. I didn't do this on purpose. Huh, maybe I need another document that goes backwards the other way.
