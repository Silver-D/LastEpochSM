* Forge
* noForgingPotentialCost: false/true
    Disables the in-game Forge Potential cost when crafting items.
This only applies to how the game internals decrease an item's Potential --
it has no impact on other Mods that want to manipulate an item's Forging
Potential for any of their special crafts.

* alwaysSealAffixWithGlyph: false/true
    Always seal a desired affix when upgrading an affix with a Glyph of Despair.

* minImplicitRangePercentInt, minAffixRangePercentInt: 0-100 (50 is 50%)
    Sets a minimum desired threshold for values when crafting/rerolling items.

    While LastEpoch_Hud has options to apply affix values to an item when it is
inserted into the Crafting Slot, the options in this module allow for a little
bit of controlled randomness during the actual forging process-- rather than setting
a number of specific, deterministic values.

    When enabling these options and Crafting an item for the first time,
if any of the the item's values are below the desired thresholds, they are rerolled.
This will only happen once for any specific item (for as long as you don't change
the values of these settings). Any further alterations of the item will only
make sure that the new values that you craft are above the desired thresholds.
    As an added bonus, if you have a Mod that allows you to alter Unique items,
its Unique Affixes will also be rerolled if they are below the desired
minAffixRangePercentInt threshold.

    As this process happens at the very end of the ingame's crafting process,
the craftings window's Results with its value stat changes had to be disabled.
Use the item's Tooltip to determine if your item has gotten weaker or stronger.

* Monolith
* noLoseWhenDie: false/true
    Don't lose stuff when you die in a Monolith.

    While LastEpoch_Hud has a similar checkbox, it actually does nothing at
this time. This setting has been tested with Monoliths at Normal and Empowered
Timelines (no stability was decreased), but I have yet to test it while having
some Gaze of Orobyss. It should work, though. I hope. I need to play more instead
of working on this.

* enableBlessingTransfers: false/true
    When this is set to true, Blessing Transfers are enabled, and the
BlessingTransfers.json file is processed.

* BlessingTransfers (the BlessingTransfers.json file):
    As this Mod is called Simple Modules, it is only fitting that this configuration
section may induce some headaches to configure. I may have overcomplicated it a bit,
but alas.

    Essentially, when properly configured, this section allows Transfers of
Blessings from one Monolith Timeline into another. This makes it possible to have,
for example, Critical Strike Multiplier and Chritical Hit Chance blessings on
different Timelines -- allowing you to finally have the option of equipping both
of these blessings at the same time.
    It also allows you to remove useless blessings from Timelines, making it much
easier to farm for specific blessings -- and the freedom to fully configure an
entire set of Timeline Blessings in order to have a desired combination of blessings
equipped at all times.
    This works for both the Blessing Rewards that you get when beating the Timeline Boss,
and even works properly for blessings that you have already unlocked and discovered.
And if you have those blessings in question equipped, you just need to unequip them
for them to jump to their configured Timelines.
+ You need to have more than one blessing discovered in a timeline in order to equip a
different blessing -- just something to keep in mind when moving blessings around,
as the blessings don't switch Timeline slots while they are equipped.

    Either way, a full explanation of the format of this section is in the
Blessing Transfers Format Explained.txt document. Have fun.
