/*
#  Read the "Blessings Transfers Format Explained.txt" document for an explanation on how any of this works.
#  Be very careful with this config if you want to use something similar, as this particular config leaves you
#  with many Timelines that end up having only one blessing. And as such, it will make it hard
#  to switch things around, as you can't unequip blessings when you only have one available in a Timeline--
#  and you need to unequip the blessings that you modified in order for them to jump to their configured timelines.
#
#  Don't forget to set the 'enableBlessingTransfers' option to true in the Mini\Conf.json file for this file to be processed.
#
#  This is just an example configuration for the BlessingTransfers.json file.
#  You may not need or want some of these blessings in your playthrough, or even in the Timelines that I put them in.
#  Use at your discretion. This is more of a usable example, as opposed to the snippets that are in the Explanation ReadMe.
#
#  Please use an online JSON validator before launching the game -- if it's not a 100% valid JSON, the JObject parser
#  will probably choke. These comments are fine, though. For some reason.
#
#  When the Blessing Transfers are enabled, the MelonLoader Console will show you every step the parser takes, so
#  when setting your config up, don't forget to look there as it makes it a bit easier to debug what went wrong.
